The Python script simulates a basic ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process using CSV files to represent each stage of the pipeline:

Extract: The script reads data from a CSV file, which represents the source data. This could be raw information from various systems such as transactional databases or external files.
Transform: After extraction, the data is processed. This may involve cleaning, filtering, or reformatting the data (e.g., handling missing values, renaming columns, converting data types) to ensure it meets the required standards for analysis or reporting.
Load: Finally, the transformed data is written to a new CSV file, simulating its loading into a data warehouse or another target system for long-term storage or further use.
The use of CSV files as source data, a staging area, and the data warehouse in this code demonstrates the concept in an accessible way, showing how raw data can be processed step-by-step before being stored in a final structured format.
